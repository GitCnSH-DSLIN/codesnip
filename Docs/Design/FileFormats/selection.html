<h1>
  Selection Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip uses this file format when it saves the current selection of snippets
  to disk. The files use a custom format.
</p>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  This is a simple plain text file format encoded as UTF-8 with byte order mark.
</p>

<h2>
  File Format
</h2>

<p>
  The file is introduced by a header, which must occupy the first line. This
  line must be:
</p>

<pre class="indent">► CodeSnip Selections v2 ◄</pre>

<p>
  No blank lines or white space may precede the header line.
</p>

<p>
  Immediately following the header line comes a list of snippet IDs for the
  snippets in the selection. There is one snippet per line. Snippets IDs must be
  well formed, but do not have to exist in the database. There must be at least
  one snippet line.
</p>

<p>
  Blanks lines are permitted anywhere after the header line. They are ignored.
</p>

<p>
  Lines are separated by a CR / LF pair.
</p>

<p class="pullout">
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
  The ► and ◄ characters were chosen for the header line because they encode in
  a unique way in UTF-8 so that ANSI and UTF-16 format files will not encode
  them correctly. This provides a second way to check for the correct file
  format in addition to the file's byte order mark.
</p>

<h2>Program Support</h2>

<p>
  This file format is supported by CodeSnip 5.
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip 4 used a similar but incompatible file format.
